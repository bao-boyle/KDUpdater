        This application demonstrates some aspects of the KDAB updater component.<br/> \
        Initially you can add target items (<a href=#L4RAction>Line 4 Receiver</a> or <a href=#PSMAction>PSM</a> devices) that use some current firmware version, to the table. <br/> \
        You can see the current compatibility level and firmware version known to the application in the status bar. The source used for finding updates is available when clicking on the button <a href=#SourcesAction>Update Sources</a>.\
        <h3>Step 1: add some items</h3> \
        Add some items to the table, using the <a href=#L4RAction>Add Line 4 Receiver</a> or <a href=#PSMAction>Add PSM</a> button. \
        <h3>Step 2: update the firmware</h3> \
        Update the firmware information by clicking on the <a href=#UpdateAction>Update</a> button : a dialog appears that lets you download and install the version <b>1.1</b> for the package <b>Firmware</b>.<br/> \
        Once that is done, the status bar is updated with the new firmware version.<br/> \
        To update the devices in the table: <a href=#SelectAllAction>select them all</a> and click on the <a href=#UploadAction>Upload Firmwares</a> button. \
        <h3>Step 3: change the compatibility level</h3> \
        The current compatibility level is <b>1</b>. To change that, click on the <a href=#CompatUpdateAction>Update Compat</a> button : a dialog appears that lets you change to a new compat level <b>2</b>, if updates at that level are available.<br/>\
        Once it's done, the status bar is updated with the new compat level and you should see a new column in the table and the application's style changed.\
        <h3>Step 4: update the firmware (one more time)</h3> \
        Now that you changed the compatibility level, you can update the firmware one more time by clicking on the <a href=#UpdateAction>Update</a> button: a dialog appears that lets you install the version <b>2.0</b> for the package <b>Firmware</b><br/> \
        This update wasn't available the first time because it needs the compatibility level <b>2</b>." );
